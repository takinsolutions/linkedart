## Takin.solutions Linked.Art Repository ##

This repository serves as a store for Linked.Art related documentation and files created and maintained by Takin.solutions in support of the implemenation of Linked.Art (https://linked.art) based semantic data solutions.

This repository is maintained by:

- Takin.solutions (https://takin.solutions)

In this repository, it is the goal of Takin.solutions to maintain different pieces of documenation and code which are of use in the adoption and creation of Linked.Art encoded semantic data.

At present we are actively developing a series of X3ML documents which allow a data transformation of certain kinds of entity into the prescribed semantic patterns of the Linked.Art standard.

These x3ml files are named after the models declared by Linked.Art. They are meant to be used with the 3M software and X3ML engine developed by ICS-FORTH (https://www.forth.gr/en/home/).

In the near future we will be storing the model documentation patterns for Linked.Art following the Zellij format and methodology developed by Takin.solutions.

The issue list is implemented in order to track errors and changes in either the model documenation or mapping.
